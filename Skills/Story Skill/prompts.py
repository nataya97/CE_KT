         "It wasn't long before Beth got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Donkey, but Donkey was nowhere to be found! Beth began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Donkey. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.",
         "Unexpectedly, she saw a slippery elephant dressed in a green coat disappearing into the trees",
         "How odd! thought Beth.",
         "For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed elephant. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.",
         "Eventually, Beth reached a clearing. In the clearing were two houses, one made from red cabbages and one made from sweets.",
